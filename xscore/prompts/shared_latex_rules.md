description: Shared LaTeX-in-YAML style guide. Inlined into prompts via `$include_shared_latex_rules` (resolved by xscore.prompts.loader). Covers YAML quoting (now split into free-text vs structural fields), LaTeX commands inside block scalars, alltt for code, and common math syntax. Used by steps 20, 24, 28, 29. v3 reorganised the YAML quoting guidance into two scoped subsections — `### Free-text fields` (model-authored content, two shapes: `''` or `|`) and `### Structural fields` (verbatim-copied metadata, plain or single-quoted). Replaces v2's single decision tree that mixed both kinds and gave free-text examples like `text: A particle moves in a circle` that contradicted the new free-text rule. v2 (filename + name renamed from latex_yaml_style → shared_latex_rules; moved out of _shared/ subfolder to live alongside other prompts).

## YAML quoting

YAML scalar quoting matters because text routinely contains LaTeX backslashes, colons, and special characters — and a single wrong quote silently destroys them. The rules below split by who owns the field's content: model-authored free text vs. verbatim-copied structural metadata.

**Never use double quotes for any non-empty string field** (universally — applies to both kinds). Double quotes interpret `\` as an escape introducer, so `"\texttt{DIV}"` parses to a literal TAB followed by `exttt{DIV}` — silently destroying the LaTeX command. (Empty `""` or `''` is fine — there's no `\` to misinterpret; prefer `''` for consistency with the free-text rule below.)

### Free-text fields (model-authored content)

For any model-owned free-text YAML field — i.e. content the model authors itself, like `student_answer`, `correct_answer`, `text`, `explanation`, `problem`, `criterion`, option `text` — use exactly one of two shapes, never anything else:

| Case | Shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty | `field: ''` | Single-quoted empty. |
| Non-empty (anything: single-letter MCQ answer, definition, prose, calculation, multi-line, anything that could contain LaTeX or a colon) | `field: \|` block scalar | Consumes every character until dedent. Immune to colon-as-key, boolean/null tokens (`yes`/`no`/`Y`/`N`/`true`/`false`/`null`), numeric coercion, backslash escapes, embedded quotes. |

The same `|` shape applies uniformly to every non-empty value. There is no special case for MCQ letters, single safe-looking words, fixed-form labels, or any other "short" or "constrained" content — every non-empty free-text value uses `|`. Emptiness is the only thing that toggles to `''`.

### Structural fields (verbatim-copied metadata)

For fields the model copies verbatim from a prior step (question `number`, option `letter`, `type`, `marks`, integers like `assigned_marks`/`confidence`/`page`), keep the existing shape from the source — these never contain LaTeX or free-text content, so plain or single-quoted is fine:

- `number: '1a'` (single-quoted to preserve string-shape even when the value looks numeric)
- `letter: A` (plain — single-letter enum, never YAML-special since A–E aren't boolean tokens)
- `type: multiple_choice` (plain — fixed enum value)
- `marks: 3`, `assigned_marks: 2`, `confidence: 7` (bare integer)

If a structural field somehow contains a backslash (LaTeX inside a number? — should never happen, but if it does), single-quote it: `field: '\texttt{...}'`. Single quotes preserve `\` literally without the double-quote escape trap.

WRONG: `text: "\texttt{DIV}"`     ← becomes `<TAB>exttt{DIV}` on parse
RIGHT (free-text): `text: |` newline `  \texttt{DIV}`     ← block scalar preserves everything
RIGHT (structural workaround): `field: '\texttt{DIV}'`     ← single quotes preserve `\texttt{DIV}`

## LaTeX commands inside block scalars

Block scalars (`|`) handle backslashes literally — write LaTeX commands directly without escaping:

- bold text → `\textbf{...}`
- italic text → `\textit{...}`
- unordered lists → `\begin{itemize}\item first\item second\end{itemize}`
- ordered/numbered lists → `\begin{enumerate}\item first\item second\end{enumerate}`
- tables → `\begin{tabular}{col-spec} cell & cell \\ next row \end{tabular}` with `\hline` between rows
- inline math → `$...$`; display math → `$$$$...$$$$`
- explicit line breaks between prose sentences → `\newline`

Constraints:
- Never use `\newline` immediately after `\begin{...}` or before `\end{...}`.
- Never use more than one `\newline` in a row.
- List items begin directly with `\item` — no `\newline` between items.
- Plain prose and introductory sentences are written verbatim (no wrapping command needed).

## Code and pseudocode (alltt)

Wrap multi-line code or pseudocode in `\begin{alltt}...\end{alltt}`; preserve indentation with literal spaces; use real newlines between lines.

Inside `\begin{alltt}...\end{alltt}`: do NOT escape `<`, `>`, `&`, `%`, `_`, `#`, `$` — alltt is verbatim-with-commands. Only escape `{` → `\{`, `}` → `\}`, backslash → `\textbackslash{}`.

Wrap inline code tokens (variable names, function calls, single keywords like `IF` / `WHILE` / `DECLARE` / `RETURN`) in `\texttt{...}`.

NEVER use `\textbf{...}` for code — bold is not monospace. Save `\textbf{...}` for emphasis on prose words.
